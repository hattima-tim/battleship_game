        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> 
            The objective of Battleship is to try and sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink all of yours. 
            Players take turns firing shots to attempt to hit the enemy ships.
            Both players can not see the fleet of the other, 
            you have to guess where is the ideal position to shoot at!
            First player to sink all the opponent's ships wins the game!
        </p>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place ships in the friendly area. 
                Friendly area means, that area is yours. See the blocks beside the friendly area gameboard?
                They are the ships.You can place them on the gameboard by drag and drop or if you are a mobile user click
                the auto place button to place ships.
            </li> 
            <li>
                After placing the ships you will see a start game button. click that and start the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now you will see two gameboards. one is yours(friendly area gameboard) and 
                another one is for the computer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click any cell of the computer gameboard to play the game. Clicking a cell of the computer gameboard 
                means you are trying to attack the computer's ships and sink them. Don't see any ships? Don't worry,
                they are there ,waiting to be sunk. Just continue guessing their position and sink them all.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you attack the computer gameboard, the computer will take revenge by attacking your own gameboard
                (friendly area gameboard). Sadly you can not do anything about it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your best bet is to sink all the computer ships before the computer does the same to you and win.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a cell color becomes blue it is a missed hit and if a cell color becomes red it is a
                successful hit.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are 5 ships on each gameboard. So whoever sinks 5 ships first,wins.
            </li>
        </ol>
